# Donut Mod
Donut Mod 3 is the third major version of the first ever large scale campaign mod for The Simpsons: Hit & Run.

# About This Release
This repo marks the first time since its final update in 2015 that this versions code is freely and officially available to look through.

This repo includes some additional files that were excluded from the release: [carsDF](Mods/Donut Mod 3/CustomFiles/art/carsDF), [hudHD](Mods/Donut Mod 3/CustomFiles/art/hudHD] and [iconsHD](Mods/Donut Mod 3/CustomFiles/art/iconsHD).

It also includes comments in INI files that would have been stripped from the compiled LMLM file.

This release is very old and we believe we have better standards now when it comes to creating our mods but, in the interest of preserving history, we've decided to release this anyways.

# Running This Mod
You can download a compiled LMLM file from the [release page on our website](https://donutteam.com/releases/view/donut-mod-3) and then follow [this guide](https://docs.donutteam.com/docs/lucasmodlauncher/setup) to setup the Mod Launcher to run it.
